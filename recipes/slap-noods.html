        <li>3 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon scallions <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
        <li>2 teaspoon garlic <em>minced (duuh)</em></li>
        <li>chilli flakes</li>

        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, water and salt by hand (or a stand mixer with a dough hook). Knead until well combined and very smooth (See note 2).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Knead each one again and roll it into a gherkin shape.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly coat each dough piece with oil then place them on a plate (or in a container). Cover with cling film then leave to rest for 1 hour (See note 3).
<li>Heat up a pot of water. While waiting, flatten each dough piece into a rectangle shape with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Press the dough in the middle lengthways using a rolling pin or a chopstick.</li>
        <li>Hold each end of the dough and pull gently until it stretches to your preferred thickness.</li>
        <li>Put the noodle on a surface. Break it apart from the middle line to make a loop.</li>
        <li>Put the noodle into the boiling water. Repeat the procedure to pull other noodles. Cook four noodles at a time (It takes about 1 minute to cook through) then place in a serving plate (bowl).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><strong>THE FUN PART</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place scallions, garlic, chilli flakes, chilli powder, Sichuan pepper and salt on top of the noodles.</li>
        <li>Heat up the oil. When it starts to smoke, pour it over the scallion, garlic, etc.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and vinegar. Stir to coat the noodles evenly.</li>
